# Configure site settings for websites

A site setting is a configurable, named value that is used by website code to modify the behavior or visual style of the site. Typically when a developer creates the website code, they reference site settings for various components to enable an end user to modify the setting values to alter the website without having to change the code, recompile, and redeploy the website.

The sample websites and templates that are provided with the installation of Power Pages contain several configurable site settings for various styles used to modify many visual elements within the site such as background style, text color, and layout width.
You can manage the following types of site settings:

- **Global settings**: These settings apply to all websites associated with the Microsoft Dataverse environment in which they're being added.
- **Website site settings**: These settings apply to specific websites that are associated with the Dataverse environment in which they're being added.

## Manage site settings

1. Using the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md), select **Site settings** under the **Website** section.

1. To create a new setting, select **New**.

1. To edit an existing setting, select the **Site Setting** listed in the grid.

1. Specify values for the fields provided: 

    - **Name**:  A label referenced by website code to retrieve the appropriate setting. The name should be unique for the associated website, because the code retrieving the setting takes the first record found with the matching name.
    
    - **Website**:  The associated website. 
    
    - **Value**: The setting
    
    - **Description**: The purpose of the setting or special instructions.

1. Select **Save & Close**.

> Bing Maps integration is not supported in the German Sovereign Cloud. If you try to create the Bingmaps/credentials setting in this environment, an error message will be displayed.
