## Anonymous access to Dataverse tables

**Anonymous access to Dataverse tables** shows the number of websites where anonymous access is allowed for certain tables in Microsoft Dataverse. It means that these sites have at least one table permission that allows anonymous users to have access to the data. For more information, go to [Table permissions](../security/assign-table-permissions.md).

Select **View details** to review the anonymous access setting for each website.

## Web Application Firewall disabled

**Web Application Firewall disabled** shows the number of production websites where [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](../security/web-application-firewall.md) is disabled.

Enabling WAF improves the security of your website and Microsoft recommends enabling WAF. For more information, go to [Enable Web Application Firewall for a website](../security/configure-web-application-firewall.md).

Select **View details** to review the WAF setting for each website.

## External authentication enabled

**External authentication enabled** shows the number of websites where there is at least one authentication provider enabled which isn't Microsoft Entra ID allowing access to Dataverse data. For more information, go to [Authentication providers](../security/authentication/index.md).

Select **View details** to review the external authentication configuration for each website.

## Site security health

**Site security health** dashboard gives you a summary of the websites in your organization related to security status. The security status of a website is determined based on certain security checks that are run for each website. For more information, go to [Security site checker](../security/site-checker-security.md).

The security health is calculated by looking at various configuration parameters and identifying common issues. These checks aren't exhaustive and we recommend you continue following website security best practices.

The criteria for classifying security health into Standard, Enhanced, and Advanced is outlined in the table provided. This criteria might change during the feature preview and before the feature is generally available.

| Health status | Description |
| - | - |
| Standard | This status means that less than 33% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| Enhanced | This status means that more than 33% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| Advanced | This status means that more than 66% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| No results | This status means that security checker isn't being run, or the site configurations don't allow checks to be run. Such as, a site that has an IP restriction setup, or a site that is stopped. To resolve, run the site checker from Power Platform Admin Center. Site checker doesn't work if a website has IP address restrictions. |

Select **View** to review the security checker results.

The checks are flagged as **Warning** when the configurations aren't the same as what Microsoft recommends. There can be cases where your business needs demand the sites to be configured in a way that isn't in the **Recommended** state.

## Site security checks

**Site security checks** shows every security check along with the number of sites for which the check result is passed, failed, warning, or not run.

## Authentication providers

**Authentication providers** shows the list of all authentication providers that are used across the websites in your tenant, along with the count of all websites in which they're used.

Select **Review** to see the list of websites where the specific authentication provider is used.

## Sites with integrations

**Sites with integrations** shows the list of all integrations with other services that are configured across the websites in your tenant, along with the count of all websites in which they're enabled. Currently, this view shows sites with the following integrations:

- Power BI visualization
- Power BI embedded service
- SharePoint
- Cloud flows

Select **Review** to see the list of websites where the specific integration is enabled. If you find a site where the integration shouldn't be enabled, work with the site maker to remove it or disable it.
