## Add yourself as an owner of the Microsoft Entra application

To manage a website that is already provisioned or resubmit provisioning if it failed, you must be an owner of the Microsoft Entra application connected to your website.

To add yourself as an owner of the Microsoft Entra application:

1. Go to the Power Platform admin center following the steps above.

1. From the **Site Details** section, copy the value of the **Application Id** field.

1. Go to Microsoft Entra associated with your tenant. More information: [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-manage-o365-subscription).

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, search for the app registration by using the application ID you copied. You might need to switch from **My apps** to **All apps**.

1. Add users or groups as owners of this app registration. More information: [Managing access to apps](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-managing-access-to-apps)

    > [!Note]
    > The user currently assigned as the owner of the application is authorized to perform this task. In situations where the application owner isn't identified or left the organization, a global administrator from your organization is authorized to update the application's ownership.

1. After you add yourself as an owner, reopen the site details page from the Power Platform admin center.
